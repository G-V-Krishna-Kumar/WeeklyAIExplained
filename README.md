What is *WeeklyAIExplained*?

**WeeklyAIExplained** is a long-term personal learning project where I aim to read, break down, and intuitively explain foundational and impactful AI research papers â€” one paper at a time.

Each explanation is presented as a Jupyter notebook and typically includes:
- Section-wise summaries of the paper  
- Visual aids (e.g., diagrams, architecture screenshots)  
- Code snippets or walkthroughs (when applicable)  

The goal is to develop deep understanding while creating high-quality, accessible learning material for others interested in AI.
